// Variables and Assignment

//You can create a new variable by declaring it
var x;
// once it exists, you can use it to store values
x = 7;
// then, you can do stuff with it, like
x = x * 12345;

// The console variable is always available, along with some other System provided libraries
// We can use them to do common things, line print to the terminal window
console.log("Our Variable X is: " + x);


// We can assign to our variable when we declare it, and use it right away
var fname = "Justin";

// This controls the age
var age = 22;
age = 23;
console.log(age);

age = fname;
console.log(age);


// Comparators
